# NOTES: *  PYTHON - CLASS DECORATOR
#        *  Creating Static and class methods
#        *  Python supports static methods: These are methods(functions)
#           that do not require an object.
#        *  staticmethod  is callable without instantiating the class
#                        Itâ€™s definition is immutable via inheritance.
#        *  classmethod is a method that gets passed the class it was called on,
#                       or the class of the instance it was called on, as first
#                       argument. This is useful when you want the method to be a
#                       factory for the class: since it gets the actual class it was
#                       called on as first argument, you can always instantiate the
#                       right class, even when subclasses are involved.
